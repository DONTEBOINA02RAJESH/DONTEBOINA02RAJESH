    ONECLICK AUTOMATION PROJECT
subject: oneclick automation is the live project that performs an automation of creating aws resources using a aws platform called lambda. The python code in the 
lambda creates all the aws resouces automatically.when we upload the input file of excel sheet in the s3 bucket, the lambda function code reads the excel file and 
triggers a merged json file and yaml file  based on the input excel file.This also triggers same json and yaml file to code commit as well.
thereby, codepipeline is automatically created whenever yaml file triggers into codecommit and therby, a cloudformation stack gets created via stack all the
aws resources are created


construction:
1. create a lamda function
2. add 3 layers as required for the python code to perform
     * lambdasinsights extension
     * awssdkpandas
     * PYYaml
3. get a python code to perform the automation(note: paste the code the collected)
4. create a s3 bucket
5. create a code commit repositary
6. make a excel sheet i.e.., input file for aws resources
7. upload the excel sheet in the s3 bucket
8.The lambda function code reads excel sheet from s3 and automatically triggers a json file and yaml file
9.The triggered yaml file in s3 also triggers into codecommit automatically
10.Based on the yaml file a codepipeline is automatically created 
10. The deployment provider provided is cloudformation and the services are automatically triggered via cloud formation and the services are created which mentioned
    in automated yaml file
11. Hence, all the services are created by oneclick and the oneclick is uploading the excel file into s3.
